Need to be inside src folder, OR ALTERNATIVELY, have the project folder set as a
default path.

then we can compile it using javac (using the path), and then call it with java (
using the package path)
note that we need to put in the whole package path, with "." rather than "\"





TODO: looks like we're unable to use javac on the Main file, most likely because it includes external libraries. Solution may be to export it all into a jar file and run that from taskscheduller.

TODO:
- Check over game prediction logging as we got an error yesterday. Should've fixed but not sure.
- Think about how best to implement making predictions that we didn't have the computer on to predict.



Need to get the model to store predictions on games even when the computer is not on and was not able to predict at the time.
